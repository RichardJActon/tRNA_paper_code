Some Data in these analyses are not publically available yet or are only
available by application. This code runs on x86\_64 GNU/Linux Kernel
version 4.15.0-66-generic, with R version 3.6.2, package and other
software dependencies are specified on a by analysis basis. Clone this
repository to install. Some analyses are moderately computationally
intensive and would benefit from being run on a high performance
computing cluster to acheive reasonable run-times. If you are trying to
replicate this analysis and have any trouble getting the code to run
please get in touch.
